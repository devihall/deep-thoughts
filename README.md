# Deep-Thoughts

A social media application called "Deep Thoughts," where users can create an account, post their thoughts for others to see, and interact with other users through these thoughts.

This app, uses a server built with Node, Express, and MongoDB to a client-side React application. This app, integrates the Apollo Server GraphQL library to handle data requests to the API. GraphQL queries were tested using the Apollo Studio Explorer interface.
